# Unity-Bluetooth
This project is to make virtual reality device based on raspberry pi- and arduino.
Here we are going to set up home launcher for android which is then to be taken as embedded os for pi using android things.
we are making a project where we are using raspberry pi 3b+ with a amoled display.
which can be used as an head mounted display(HMD) for virtual reality for now.
we are using MPU,mcu and some other stuff to do interaction.
